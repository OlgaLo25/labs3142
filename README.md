This is programming assignment exposed to OOP paradigm, as well as practice with refactoringcode to make it more maintainable.
This program include:
Folders: data, include, obj, ouput, src and test.
  "include" consists of .h files wich include the stracter and declared methods with private and public fields.
  "controller" consists with the declare the functions which can controll data.
  "structure" include the enum with grades and structure of data
  "utils" include the regular functions which do the manipulations in different classes. Can be applied to any method in the classes.
  "write_read" declare the methods for write and read files

Every header file has .cpp file, where all logic presents. 


The “Main” is for input files, which can be done from the keyboard, file, or any other method. On this program the input was done as an expression in the method itself for tests, but it can easily change. Also calling “Postfix.h” and “Calculator.h” are done from the “main''.

The main purpose of this program was to make a structured program with Makefile and Test.
Makefile does all actions with the program such as, compile is, makes .cpp files, object .o files, and runs the test file. At the end, Makefile cleans all files which were created during its run. 
All the tests have been done on GitHub and were done successfully.
A well-structured file makes it easy to navigate the program, find errors, and some classes can be used standalone without being tied to the rest of the program. 
Makefile and test allows you to make sure that everything works and there are no errors:  syntactic, compilation and logical
